# 🎭 Impossible To-Do List

A seemingly normal To-Do List application that secretly "trolls" users with playful interactions that make tasks harder (but not impossible) to manage.

## 🎪 Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Add tasks
- ✅ View list of tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- ✅ Delete tasks
- 💾 LocalStorage persistence

### Troll Features
Each task gets assigned a random troll type when created. Each troll can only activate a limited number of times (default: 2) before the card becomes normal:

1. **Runaway Card** 🏃 - Card slides to a random position when hovered
2. **Blurry Vision** 👓 - Text becomes blurry on hover (click to clear)
3. **Mirror Text** 🪞 - Text appears mirrored (double-click to fix)
4. **Shy Delete Button** 😳 - Delete button shrinks and moves away on hover
5. **Fake Complete** ✅❌ - Shows fake completion, then reverts
6. **Clingy Card** 🤗 - Card follows your cursor when trying to delete

### Rewards
- 🎊 **Confetti Celebration** - Celebratory confetti when you actually complete a task!
